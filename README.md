# 🌐 JSXCore 

This is a lightweight, high-performance, component based C# web framework that uses server-side string literal rendering to deliver static web applications.

## Features 🎉

- Uses C# 11 string literals as jsx-esque components.
- JavaScript classes ported to C# for intellisense and type safety.
