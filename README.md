# 🌐 JSXCore 

JSXCore is a lightweight, high-performance, component-based C# web framework that uses server-side string literal rendering to deliver static web applications.

## Features 🎉

- Uses C# 11 string literals as jsx-esque components.
- JavaScript classes ported to C# for intellisense and type safety.
- Single UTF-8 string build with external content baked to base64 strings.
- Reactive server-side variables.
- Tailwind CSS support with optional custom styling.
- Nothing more really, this is started as a joke, but it's starting to get serious.

## Getting Started 🚀

#### To get started with the framework, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of .NET from the [official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `$ git clone https://github.com/bernadotornado/JSXCore.git`.
3. Rename folder to your apps name.
4. Move to app folder with `$ cd <YOUR_APPS_NAME>/app`.

#### Source Control
You may want you use your own version control after the initial cloning. For this delete the `.git` folder at the root of the project. Then create a new one with:

```
